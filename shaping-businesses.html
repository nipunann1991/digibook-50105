						<p>We expect creativity and flexibility from employees – so our structures should reflect that. The way we set our business models, manage employees and provide platforms (not discrete systems) to support them must be holistic.</p>
						<p>In Workplace 2.0, we can rely on line managers to adopt new ways of working – and build up their confidence in a more dispersed, collaborative model with technology that supports clean, efficient delivery on projects. </p>
						<p>But having in place the right structures and chains of command; clear processes and procedures; and the right level of insight into team performance are all vital tools to raise their confidence.
						</p>
						<p>Flatter structures help. And a project-based approach to management – emphasising inputs, outputs and outcomes, rather than particular ways of working – can be supported with the right collaboration systems.</p> 
						<p>Above all, concise, timely, accurate data about performance can make all the difference to management agility.

	 					<h3>Agile: top-down, bottom-up.</h3>
	 					<p> Agility and flexibility within teams is clearly important. As we've seen, clearly stated objectives, allied with well-structured autonomy and systems that ensure clarity between collaborators, can deliver on that score.</p>

						<p>But that demands a top-down embrace of new approaches from leadership. Organisational culture and behaviour is dictated by leadership behaviours. Workplace 2.0 will place an intolerable strain on line managers if they’re expected to coordinate work-anywhere teams with flexible processes while the senior leadership expects them to deliver progress updates using old-fashioned reporting lines and metrics more suited to old office norms.</p>

						<p>Flatter structures help. And a project-based approach to management – emphasising inputs, outputs and outcomes, rather than particular ways of working – can be supported with the right collaboration systems.</p>

						<p>Above all, concise, timely, accurate data about performance can make all the difference to management agility. That doesn’t replace the old management skills – it hones them, like a sports team coach who knows the game; knows their playing personnel; and has the performance data to tune their approach.</p>

	 					<h3>Guide to diverse teams.</h3>

	 					<p> <i>Harvard Business Review’s guide </i>to managing global teams is an excellent checklist for businesses at any stage of building out a new workplace model. And one key theme from that work is that power dynamics must be respected. Dispersed teams can end up resolving into “in groups” and “out groups” – a problem as acute for office-based versus mobile workers as it is for, say, multicultural teams in which one culture heavily predominates.</p>

						<p>Much of the advice to leaders here is based around communication:</p>

	 					<ul class="list-bullets ">
	 						<li><span class="hightlited"> Re-state the mission frequently, </span>  and contextualise the team’s contribution.
	 						</li>

							<li><span class="hightlited">Maintain frequent, and low-level, </span> communications – not just orders and recriminations.</li>

							<li><span class="hightlited">Create unstructured time – </span> the old office has its watercooler, workplace 2.0 needs an equivalent.</li>		

							<li><span class="hightlited">Channel disagreement – </span>even the best collaborative tools can spur fights over control; but if disagreement is not aired, it can simmer and then explode.</li>
							
							<li><span class="hightlited">Train for dialogue – </span>cross-cultural teams, in particular, might need to learn how to communicate with different intensity. (Some might say the same is true of in-office teams…)</li>
							
							<li><span class="hightlited">Conscious inclusivity –</span> within the old workplace, unconscious biases in behaviour can be more easily monitored. With dispersed teams, they might be harder to spot. </li>

						<h3>Four building blocks to shape flexible structures.</h3>

						<ul class="list-bullets ">
	 						<li><span class="hightlited"> Enterprise Systems. </span> HR data stuck in silos means analytics is always going to be hobbled. You need access to all data under one roof. IT strategy should be looking at smarter data-warehouse solutions and consistency in formatting.
	 						
	 						<li><span class="hightlited"> Accurate data. </span> Some systems are great at managing unstructured data; most aren’t (yet). If the data isn’t timely and comparable, it’s garbage.
	 						
	 						<li><span class="hightlited"> Easy-to-use systems. </span>That IT staffer with a passion for algorithms and black-box mathematical models has her uses. But designing your analytics engine isn’t one of them. Simple, actionable analytical models are key. HR people need to get it; and communicate it.
	 						
	 						<li><span class="hightlited"> Operational efficiency. </span>The facts change in HR all the time. In big organisations, hundreds of people come and go every month. Data should match the needs of the business in each area – some updating in real time, some more strategic. Operational decisions can be enhanced with data pushed to mobile devices in some cases; in others, complex data from a variety of sources can undergo detailed analysis for insights relevant to strategic planning.
